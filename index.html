        <h1>Christmas Billboard Top 100</h1>
        <p>By: Willa Liou</p>
        <p class="blurb">
            Every year, as the holiday season rolls around, Christmas music fills the air—whether it's in stores, on the radio, or at family gatherings. The same familiar songs seem to appear, bringing a sense of nostalgia and tradition. But have you ever wondered which songs have truly stood the test of time? What makes certain Christmas carols perennial favorites, while others fade into obscurity?
            This project was born out of my own curiosity about the holiday tunes that have made their way to the top of the charts year after year. By exploring the Christmas Billboard Top 100 dataset from 1958 to 2017, I set out to understand how these songs have evolved and what keeps them so popular. From the most iconic hits to the less obvious chart-toppers, each graph in this portfolio tells a different part of the story—about their rise, their longevity, and their cultural impact.
            This portfolio explores the fascinating trends and patterns in Christmas music’s chart history, and join me as I discover why certain carols have become timeless staples of the holiday season.
